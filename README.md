# vim-comment
Comment/uncomment in Vim

The [vim-comment](https://github.com/ThatsWhatSheCoded/vim-comment) plug-in
will comment or uncomment lines in Normal and Visual mode for supported
filetypes.


## Installation

For ease of maintenance and updates, I recommend a plug-in manager such as
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) or
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git).

There is also the option of using the native Vim 8 packages loading (see: `:help packages`).


## Documentation

This plugin relies on the `<leader>` key. By default, comment is remapped to
`<leader>c` and uncomment is remapped to `<leader>u`.

This plugin supports the following file types:
* C
* C++
* Java
* JavaScript
* Make
* Python
* Bash
* Tmux
* Markdown
* Text
* Vim
